- Processing status
**Tools**:
- Return validation
- Policy enforcement
- Status tracking
- Label generation
**Test Cases**:
- Policy compliance
- Process validation
- Status tracking
- Integration testing
- Error handling

### 6. Refunds Agent
**Goal**: Process refund requests and handle payment reversals
**Memory**:
- Refund policies
- Payment history
- Processing rules
- Status tracking
**Tools**:
- Payment processing
- Refund validation
- Status updates
- Receipt generation
**Test Cases**:
- Payment processing accuracy
- Policy compliance
- Status tracking
- Security validation
- Integration testing
